Each have kernel size 3 and stride 2. Documentation to make convolutional layers: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html\n","- Think about strided convolutions from the lecture, as convolutions with stride = 1 and downsampling. For strided convolution, what padding do you need for preserving the spatial resolution? (Hint => padding = kernel_size // 2) - Think why?\n","- Each convolutional layer is accompanied by a Batchnorm and ReLU layer.\n","- Finally, you want to average pool over the spatial dimensions to reduce them to 1 x 1.

Downsampling 32x is standard for most image models.\n","\n","**Why does a very simple network have high channel sizes**?\n","\n","Every time you downsample 2x, you do 4x less computation (at same channel size). To maintain the same level of computation, you 2x increase # of channels, which increases computation by 4x. So, balances out to same computation. Another intuition is - as you downsample, you lose spatial information. We want to preserve some of it in the channel dimension.\n","\n","**What is return_feats?**\n","\n","It essentially returns the second-to-last-layer features of a given image.
